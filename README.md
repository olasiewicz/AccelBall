# AccelBall
Defeat the game levels using the motion sensor (accelerometer) to control the ball, whose major  task is to collect all bonuses scattered all over the screen in the most strategic places. Sit back and stay focused, otherwise you fail to reach the goal :). After passing the board  next level is enabled.

Have fun and a lot of patience.
